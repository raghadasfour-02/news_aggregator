# Raghad's News Aggregator
A web app designed to curate news articles and keep you up to date with what's going on in the world.

### Inspiration
Most of us are generally aware of the bias we expose ourselves to when reading news from one source. That being said, it takes too much work to conduct a thorough investigation of *everything* we read on the internet. I decided to improve my Python skills using Django's framework to create a news aggregator. This aggregator aims to provide you with several sources for news all in one. Ultimately, the goal is to make it easier to explore other perspectives when reading about what's happening in the world. 

### What did I learn? [ABOUT PROGRAMMING]
- Deeper understanding of Django's architecture (MVC: Models, Views, Controllers)
- Enhanced my skills in Python (inheritance and composition, exception handling, decorators)

### What did I learn? [ABOUT WRITING SOFTWARE]
- Creating a loosely coupled system enables ease in adding new features
- Creating methods with ease of modification in mind (each method should serve one purpose only)

### What's next?
- Parse key words from news articles to identify possible political and religious affiliations
- Categorize news articles as "heavily opinionated / one-sided" or "mostly objective"
- Create a filter to exclude news articles about certain topics (i.e. exclude articles that may be triggering/graphic)
